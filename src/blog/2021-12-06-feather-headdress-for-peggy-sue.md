Madame Risquée ordered a full-length ostrich feather headdress, just handig over a bunch of long, white high quality feathers. Though they're not at all heavy, they are unwieldy so have to be held in place in such a manner that they are anchored securely and don't flap about during performances. As I don't use YouTube to copy others (I only watch old movies or read books about fashion/costume as well as visit museums) I had to come up with a way to place them at intervals that does them justice….
