Schiaparelli-inspired shoe headpiece

Another headpiece made for the Surrealist Ball put on by Amsterdam Spook, this is very dear to my heart-- Elsa Schiaparelli, an Italian designer I look up to as my biggest inspiration, made an all-black wool version in 1937 meant for Mae West (who she was designing costumes for at the time). The idea came from a photograph taken in 1933 by Salvador Dali's wife of him wearing a shoe on his head as well as 1 perched on his shoulder. I took the liberty of patterning it on a genuine 1940s shoe and adding a sole in Schiaparelli's signature color which she named Shocking Pink. It's edged inside with a grosgrain band tacked at intervals so it can be securely attached to hair.
