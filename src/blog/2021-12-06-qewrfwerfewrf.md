**Spats**, a shortening of **spatterdashes**, or **spatter guards** are a type of classic footwear accessory for outdoor wear, covering the instep and the ankle. Spats are distinct from gaiters,  which are garments worn over the lower trouser leg as well as the shoe.\
\
Spats were worn by men and, less commonly, by women in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They fell out of frequent use during the 1920s. Made of white cloth, grey or brown felt material, spats buttoned around the ankle. Their intended practical purpose was to protect shoes and socks from mud or rain, but also served as a feature of stylish dress in accordance with the fashions of the period.
