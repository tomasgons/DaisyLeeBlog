        <h2>Costuming</h2>
         <p class = "blurb">
With years of costuming experience (starting with San Francisco drag queens in the early '80s, then morning in to Circus Elleboog, an Amsterdam children's circus), I will create costumes tailored to an act. Comfort/freedom of movement and washability are all factors to take into consideration when designing. In one memorable situation, safety was of paramount importance for an act involving fire.
Alternately- depending on how often a costume will be worn & budget- I can alter existing garments (sourced from flea markets, vintage shops). There's a cape for every situation!

          <h3>Head Pieces</h3>
          <p class="blurb">Headpieces are often the make-or-break element of a costume or special occasion.
I look to historical images and films for inspiration and collect hats & headpieces to see/feel what has stood the test of time. Weight & balance are crucial!
I can source vintage/antique elements (or already have in stock) to create a unique piece

    <h2 class="sub-article-title">Schiaparelli-inspired shoe headpiece</h2>

   <img src="/assets/blog/pics/headpieces/shoehead.jpg" alt=""/>
   
    </figure>
    <p>Another headpiece made for the Surrealist Ball put on by Amsterdam Spook, this is very dear to my heart-- 
    Elsa Schiaparelli, an Italian designer I look up to as my biggest inspiration, made an all-black wool version in 1937 meant for Mae West (who she was designing costumes for at the time).
    The idea came from a photograph taken in 1933 by Salvador Dali's wife of him wearing a shoe on his head as well as 1 perched on his shoulder. 
    I took the liberty of patterning it on a genuine 1940s shoe and adding a sole in Schiaparelli's signature color which she named Shocking Pink. 
    It's edged inside with a grosgrain band tacked at intervals so it can be securely attached to hair.

        <h2>Repairs & Restorations</h2>
        <p class="blurb">
It's a crying shame to chuck out favorite garments once they're showing wear. Often all that's needed is reinforcement.
A classic cyclist problem is the seat of jeans that are fine elsewhere-- using different shades of thread and a sturdy patch they can often be saved almost invisibly for years more use.
I also have a stock of antique lace,vintage buttons, etc accumulated to restore things to former glory.
Wool/mohair/plaid and tweed are especially fun to tackle
